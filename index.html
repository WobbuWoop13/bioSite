      <h2>Gabriel Michael Conner</h2>
      <p>
        Gabriel's goals in the three years since he graduated high school were non-existent when he was told his options were to move to Atlanta, Georgia, with his parents or Northern Oregon with his siblings. Then, he started saving money to purchase his first car. Having wholly paid off the vehicle last year, Gabe feels accomplished completing his first actual loan.

      <p>
        This was accomplished mainly due to his hard work in his second-ever job and his first out of high school, Kohlâ€™s. Within a year of working, starting as a holiday hire and becoming a part-time employee, Gabe was offered the Full-Time Department Lead position in the shoe department. This naturally allowed Gabe to be comfortable being able to take care of the one thing he had to leave behind when moving from home: a cat. However, when mentally deciding on the one he wanted to adopt, life naturally surprised him with two Void sisters who instantly needed to become a part of the family.
