      <p>
        Growing up in what could have been the equivalent of the middle of nowhere sure has its pros and cons, depending on the kind of person you are. Unfortunately, this wasn't available for somebody who enjoyed new technology, film, and video games. Having been stuck with (if lucky) 1mpbs internet, being a farm hand was the only real hobby available, and that was just life.

        Moving away, however, allowed Gabe unfettered access to luxuries he didnâ€™t have before. Working out, or any physical exercise class, was a joke for someone who spent all their free time doing yard work. But joining a gym to get better physical health quickly became a new addiction and so did playing games on the first computer he researched and built. The latest addition is photo-scanning objects with his phone and then 3D printing them out for others to paint or display.
