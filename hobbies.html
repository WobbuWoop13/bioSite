      <p>
        Growing up in what could have been the equivalent of the middle of nowhere sure has its pros and cons, depending on the kind of person you are. Unfortunately, this wasn't suitable for somebody who enjoyed new technology, films, and video games. Having been stuck with (if lucky) 1mpbs internet, being a farm hand was the only real hobby available, and that was just life. Gabe made most of his friends on Xbox Live by making do with what was given. Though some older folks may scoff at this notion, these have been lifelong pals Gabe would move mountains for.

        Moving away, however, allowed Gabe unfettered access to luxuries he didn’t have before. Working out, or any physical exercise class, was a joke for someone who spent all their free time doing yard work on a farm. But joining a gym to get better physical health quickly became a new addiction, as bettering himself gave him a newfound confidence that wasn’t present before. With more free time and disposable income, one of the first things Gabe chose to do was build his computer. Not only because he was about to start college, but he also wanted to keep in touch with his friends (who moved to PC, primarily  <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198265331198/" target="_blank">Steam</a>) and tinker in the world of 3D Printing. Finding enjoyment in painting miniature figures, the obvious next step was to create his own and anything that came to mind.
