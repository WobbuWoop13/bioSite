        <h2>About Gabe</h2>
        <p>Gabriel Michael Conner is a 21-year-old male currently living in Albany, Oregon. Having been born in Eagle Point, Oregon, on a 60-acre farm, a life of work is something he has always known. From building fences, learning to lay concrete, and herding cattle, it was a life you could imagine from Yellow Stone. Living 20 miles outside of the small town, electronics and the internet were always a foreign treat. This isn’t to say it wasn’t accessible by any means, but everything was dated by at least a decade, with dial-up internet lasting in this house until 2011.</p>

        <p>Once high school graduation came creeping closer, his parents told Gabriel that they would be moving to Georgia to follow a dream of his father's. Not wanting to upend what life he knew utterly, he started looking at opportunities to move north in the state and be close to his older siblings. Three years later, a new life has been found in Albany, Oregon.</p>
        <br>
        <p>During this time, Gabriel got a job at a local Kohl’s and became a full-time Shoe Lead within a year of working there. He saved his money to buy a car, and even stepped out of his comfort zone and found a second home at the gym (something he never wanted to do in school) and got himself into shape. These changes allowed him to feel more confident in himself, leading to other new hobbies like 3D printing. Outside of these, though, he will sure be glad to tell you all about Korean and Chinese “light novels,” as well as playing video games on his computer with the friends he made in childhood. </p>
